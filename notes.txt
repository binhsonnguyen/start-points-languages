I structure the repo so that each language has its own folder with its
own _docker_context sub-folder which contains the Dockerfile (and context)
for creating the language's base docker image. For example:
  Go/_docker_context/Dockerfile
is used to script the creation of the Go docker image

Each language+test has its own language sub-folder with its
own _docker_context sub-folder which contains the Dockerfile (and context)
for creating the language+test's docker image. For example:
  Go/testing/_docker_context/Dockerfile
is used to script the creation of the Go+testing docker image.

New docker images are pushed to their cyberdojofoundation hub
https://hub.docker.com/u/cyberdojofoundation/
as follows

$ docker login
username: jonjagger
password: ...
email: ...

$ docker push cyberdojofoundation/NAME
