Work in progress.
Aiming for a command such as this...

$ cyber-dojo languages jon=https://github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo-languages.git

from a cyber-dojo server which will pull the repo and put it into a docker
data-container called jon which will then used as the source of languages in the setup 
page.
